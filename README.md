# DevOps Lab 1

A web application that simply shows the current time in Moscow.

There are two versions:

* in Python (using [Starlette](starlette.io) as the backend)  
  See the [development decisions](./app_python/PYTHON.md) for the Python project.
* in TypeScript (using [Sapper](sapper.svelte.dev) as the renderer for a static webpage)  
  See the [development decisions](app_ts/TYPESCRIPT.md) for the TypeScript project.
